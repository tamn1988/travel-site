Web Developer Workflow


`````````````````````````````Git

Project = Repository (repo)
Working directory = the folder location on your computer where the project lives
Staging = preparing, getting ready. Controls what gets committed
Commit = Git's way of "saving". files needed to be staged before they can be commited

Git stores your repository in a hidden folder in your local machine. A push request is required to sync your files to a webserver. Alternatively, you can can sync the files from the webserver to your local machine using a pull request

cd into your working directory
use "git init" to create repository

git status -- which files as changed. red file names means that have not been add to staging. 
git add "filename" - to add file to staging      -git add -A    - will add all files on git status to staging
git commit -m "Commit message"  - commits changes
git checkout -- . grabs files from local repo
git clone "link"   - will clone a repo from a server
git remote -v  - tells you the location git thinks you want to push the files to
git remote set-url origin "url here"  - tells git the url you want to push to
git push origin "branch"  - will push to whatever origin url you have set


````````````````````````````Node and NPM

npm init  - use it to create a package.json file
npm install --save    - will your packages to the dependancies section of the package.json file
npm install --save-dev will install packages to the dev depandencies section of the package.json file. Meaning theyre packages meant to make our lives easier as developers. regular npm install --save means it is a dependancy for browsers
