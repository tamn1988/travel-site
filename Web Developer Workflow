Web Developer Workflow


`````````````````````````````Git

Project = Repository (repo)
Working directory = the folder location on your computer where the project lives
Staging = preparing, getting ready. Controls what gets committed
Commit = Git's way of "saving". files needed to be staged before they can be commited

Git stores your repository in a hidden folder in your local machine. A push request is required to sync your files to a webserver. Alternatively, you can can sync the files from the webserver to your local machine using a pull request

cd into your working directory
use "git init" to create repository

git status -- which files as changed. red file names means that have not been add to staging. 
git add "filename" - to add file to staging      -git add -A    - will add all files on git status to staging
git commit -m "Commit message"  - commits changes
git checkout -- . grabs files from local repo
git clone "link"   - will clone a repo from a server
git remote -v  - tells you the location git thinks you want to push the files to
git remote set-url origin "url here"  - tells git the url you want to push to
git push origin "branch"  - will push to whatever origin url you have set


````````````````````````````Node and NPM

npm init  - use it to create a package.json file
npm install --save    - will your packages to the dependancies section of the package.json file
npm install --save-dev will install packages to the dev depandencies section of the package.json file. Meaning theyre packages meant to make our lives easier as developers. regular npm install --save means it is a dependancy for browsers


```````````````````````````Gulp
What is gulp?
	A build system
	A build tool
	A task runner
	gulp = automation

Lightweight
Efficient
Incredibly quick

Steps to installing gulp

1. Install globally
npm install packagename --global

2. install locally in your project file.


on gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');

to run the default gulp task you can just type "gulp" in the command line.
to run a specific task you can type "gulp nameoftask"


gulp.src()  - lets us tell gulp where to get data from

gulp.dest()  - directory or folder where we want data to go to

gulp.pipe()  - the pipe between src and dest where we can manipulate the data





```````````````````````````````CSS file Architecture

CSS Organization

1. File architecture
use modules to break our css into sections of codes. and using @import and postcss to merge it all into one file.

2. Identify patterns in design
BEM - an abstract way of thinking about our interface

B - Block. A independant reusable part of our design
E - An element belongs to a block. it cannot be used outside of a block it belongs to.  blockclassname__elementname is the way to name element classes
M - Modifier. can be used on a bloack or an element to indicate a change to the default state of an object. MODIFIERS USE --CLASSNAME

	-css selectors should target elements directly with classes, instead of relying on type selectors, descendent selectors, and the cascade
	- because we are limiting cascade we are free to move blocks around and reuse them throughout the page
	-blocks can be nested inside other blocks.
	-identify patterns, in our design and then create single-responsibility blocks
		there is no reason to code a pattern more than once
	-makes the relationship between our html and css clear


3. Rules to follow for creating class names and writing our css selectors



You can create a file name that starts with an underscore. You're indicating to other developers that the file is a partial file.


var gulp = require('gulp')
var watch = require('gulp-watch');
var postcss = require('gulp-postcss');   - postcss
var autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer');   - auto prefixer
var cssvars = require('postcss-simple-vars'); - postcss variables
var nested = require('postcss-nested');  - postcss nesting
var cssImport = require('postcss-import');  -postcss imports to import partials


IMPORTS NEED TO BE AT THE TOP OF CSS FILES.


When Nesting is postcss. PostCSS naturally creates descendant selectors. WHICH GOES AGAINST THE BEM PHILOSIPHY. What we can do is use the & sign in our nesting selectors. And which this does is the & compiled as the name of the parent selector plus whatever you put behind it.

For example.

.large-hero{
	position:relative;

	/*this selector just means .large-hero__text-content*/
	&__text-content {
		css properties here
	}
}







REM  - Takes the default of the root element. Which is HTML. The default is usually 16px for font-size;




A MIXIN IS JUST A REUSABLE PART OF CSS CODE



```````````````````````````````````Mobile first responsive design


Where do we begin?
	Start with css first and build using mobile first apporach.
	Use postCss to make mixins for media queries to adjust content according to viewport width




Responsive images

	reponsive imague sitatutons

	1. art direction and cropping situation. Picutre element is used when we need to control art direction for screen sizes
		ALWAYS BEGIN WITH THE SMALLEST IMAGE FIRST

		<picture>
			<source srcset="images/dog-crop-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 1200px)"
			<source srcset="images/dog-crop-medium.jpg" media="(min-width: 760px)"
			<img src ="images/dog-crop-small.jpg" alt="puppy in the sand">
		</picture>

	2. image resolution and file size. This is use when we need faster load times.
		<img srcset="images/dog-resolution-small.jpg 570w, images/dog-resolution-medium.jpg 1200w, images/dog-resolution-large.jpg 1920w" alt="puppy in the sand">

		The browser will figure out which image to download.



	The two methods can be combined. 

	      <picture>
        <source srcset="assets/images/hero--large.jpg, assets/images/hero--large-hi-dpi.jpg 3840w" media="(min-width: 1380px)">
        <source srcset="assets/images/hero--medium.jpg assets/images/hero--medium-hi-dpi.jpg 2760w" media="(min-width: 990px)">
        <source srcset="assets/images/hero--small.jpg, assets/images/hero--small-hi-dpi.jpg 1980w" media="(min-width: 640px)">
        <img srcset="assets/images/hero--smaller.jpg, assets/images/hero--smaller-hi-dpi.jpg 1280w" alt="Coastal view of of ocean and Mountains">
      </picture>



	We need to tell the web browser what size the image will be render at. Browsers assume images will take the full width. So they will always grab a larger dpi than normal copy due to not knowing we will only display the image at 30% width for example;

	this is done by adding sizes="404px" to the source element inside the picture element


  By default web browsers treat images as inline level elements. Basically the browser thinks this image is a line of text. the browsers leaves a gap to make room for letters like y and g where the bottom sticks under






```````````````````````````````Git Branches


git branch -- will list all the branches in our repo
git branch branchname -creates a new branch
git checkout branchname - to switch branches
git reset pathname -- will remove file from stage

to merge branches to master
first check out to master branch
then
git merge branchname

git branch -d branchname to delete branch from local git

Create a new branch for each new feature of our project.

git checkout -b branchname   -- will create a new branch and switch over to it




The more files a visitor has to download the slower it will take to load.
Combine your icons into a sprite. (one imagine files that holds all svgs)




Object-oriented programming

What is object-oriented programming?

Stop thinking in terms of individual variables an functions.
Begin thinking in terms of cohesive, self-sufficient objects.


When we require a file, the code from that file is immediately executed.
the return of the require file is actually and object.

require does not work in the browser since the browser does not access to the directory. Webpack is needed
webpack is used for this.

to use webpack.

In order to use webpack the root directory neeeds webpack.config.js file. the file name is very strict

The require('dirname') returns an object. Node js and webpack expects and exports object that tells the object what to return.


Lazy Loading
	allows assets to only download as needed
